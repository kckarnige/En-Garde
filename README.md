# En Garde!

Have you ever felt fighting mobs was a little TOO easy with a shield?   
Do you miss shields not being so extremely overpowered against mobs?

Yeah? Well this might just be the mod for you!

This mod balances the shield by adding a simple parry mechanic! Block as soon as a mob attacks and they bounce right off your shield, but if you're too early or just stand there blocking, it isn't gonna be as pretty..

I personally think this is a more balanced way to keep shields from being too overpowered, while still letting you negate any damage like usual, if you're quick enough.

Just about everything in this mod is configurable, so go wild!

<details>
<summary><b><i>!! Important if you want modded shields to work !!</i></b></summary>

Either make a datapack, or add the item tag data to your mod like so:

`data\en_garde\tags\item\shields.json`

And fill it with something like this, replacing the item ids here with your own

```json
{
  "values": [
    "enderscape:end_stone_rubble_shield",
    "enderscape:mirestone_rubble_shield",
    "enderscape:veradite_rubble_shield",
    "enderscape:kurodite_rubble_shield",
    "amyshield:amethyst_shield"
  ]
}
```
</details>
